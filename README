Photoframed is a script written in PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript for running in a full-screen browser on a custom photoframe.

Features:
 - Photos
 - XML feeds
 - Traffic map
 - Webcams
 - Clock
 - Slick animations

Installation instructions:
 - Set up a webserver (apache or WAMP or whatever), make sure that PHP has enough memory and that you have the GD library installed!
 - Copy user/config.php.default to user/config.php and adjust it to your preferences
 - Make sure that the cache directory is writeable (sudo chmod -R 0777 cache)
 - Set the right path in index.xul
 - Use a fullscreen browser, such as Firefox with this add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1568

Upgrading instructions:
 - Make a backup of your user folder
 - Throw away the photoframed directory
 - Copy the new directory
 - Make sure that the cache directory is writeable (sudo chmod -R 0777 cache)
 - Put back the user folder
 - Check config.php.default to see new options
 
Notes:
 - Works best in Firefox, but *could* work just fine in other browsers
 - The animations can be quite heavy for slow machines, you can disable them in the config
 - About message can also be hidden using the config
 - In 13-01-2010 the name was changed from Photogenix to Photoframed, to prevent confusion with the original branch
